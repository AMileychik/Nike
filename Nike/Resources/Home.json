                    "description": "Although strap and band fit tend to provide the most clear signs that a bra correctly fits, a few other indicators can signal the wrong size, said Sweeney. \n\nA bra that is too small will often:\n\n- Have a neckline and/or underarm area that causes the breast to spill or cut out of the sides of the bra\n- Feature a neckline and/or underarm area that sits too low on the body\n- Contain a cup area that is too short, which can cause the bottom band to ride up and sit on the bottom of the breast rather than just below the breast tissue \n\nA bra that is too big will often: \n\n- Show excess fabric bunching or gathering throughout the cup area \n- Have a neckline and/or underarm area that sits too high, potentially rubbing the neck or underarm and causing chafing \n- Not provide any compression or support, or allow for too much breast movement",
